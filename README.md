# The Enchanted Ruins

Once upon a time, this ruins of Gitburg, was a place where seekers and explorers flocked to this city in search of a hidden treasure. The city whispered tales of a fragmented flag, concealed within the encrypted depths.

Alas, a mysterious figure, drawn by the allure of the hidden treasure, trespassed into our virtual sanctuary. With stealth and cunning, they absconded with two of the three precious fragments, leaving our digital haven momentarily shaken.

However, the cunning figure left behind traces in history, revealing his steps. These breadcrumbs now mark the thief's path, hinting at the stolen fragments' resting place. Little did the thief know, the fragments were enchanted by the powerful essence of MITE, rendering them unusable without the complete set.

Brave seekers, your quest now involves not only decoding the tales within, but also recovering the pilfered fragments to unlock the enchanting secrets hidden within the MITE-infused flag. May your digital journey be both challenging and triumphant!
